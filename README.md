## About the project![veg_icon1-export](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119619241/208243523-e02b56e1-93dd-47b6-ae83-591d72c3d471.png)

*VeggiePy is a code editor developed with Python for Python.*

> Built using Python's GUI package, Tkinter, VeggiePy is a project that aims to enhance my personal growth as an aspiring software developer. 

> VeggiePy is not a replacement for the many free, full-featured code editors or more sophisticated IDEs readily available. Instead, it is a learning experience focused on exploring the integral tools used in software development to gain a deep understanding of how programs come together from the inside out.

*Pixelated aesthetic* 

> VeggiePy's design style is modeled after 8-bit/16-bit art. The icons found throughout the application were drawn by me specifically for Veggie's interface.
